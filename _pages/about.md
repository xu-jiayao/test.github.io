# Profile 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hosei University in March 2024 and my M.S. degree in September 2020. 

My **research interest** lies in _**Image Codec design**_ based on _**Compressive Sensing**_, which encompasses _**Hardware Implementation**_ and _**Deep Learning**_. 

As one of the leading areas in representing low-dimensional structured data, **Compressive Sensing** stands out as a pioneering theory in signal sampling. It leverages data sparsity to enable downsampling, thereby minimizing hardware demands in analog-to-digital (ADC) processing. 

Throughout my doctoral and master's studies, I have authored 10 papers, most of which have been published in leading conferences and journals in the fields of image processing and hardware implementation, including **TMM, CVM, MMM, ISCAS, DCC, ICIP, IJCNN**, among others. 

I possess a strong ability for **self-directed learning** and have **independently acquired knowledge** in areas relevant to my research topic during my graduate studies, as well as in iOS application development during my undergraduate studies.

I am currently actively seeking employment opportunities and aspire to join a growth-oriented team where I can make meaningful contributions to advancement and development.

- Introduction:

Provide on-campus students with services such as checking lecture schedules, library book collection information, checking campus card balances, and recharging.

- Responsibility:
  
1. Participated in designing APIs, as well as modifying API documentation to ensure effective utilization
and comprehension by the development team.

2. Refactored the existing application, utilizing Git version control to streamline code collaboration and
project management. Various design patterns were employed to minimize coupling and improve code maintainability.

3. Designed and implemented the functionality of the library and login modules, incorporating testing
methods to validate code accuracy and fortify system stability.

4. Implemented the network layer, performing JSON encapsulation of data packets. Collaborated with
the backend team to test the network layer, ensuring seamless communication with backend services and
making necessary adjustments to meet requirements.
