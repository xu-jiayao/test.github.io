# 🙋‍♀️ Profile 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hosei University in March 2024 and my M.S. degree in September 2020. 

My **research interest** lies in _**Image Codec design**_ based on _**Compressive Sensing**_, which encompasses _**Hardware Implementation**_ and _**Deep Learning**_. 

Throughout my doctoral and master's studies, I have authored **10 papers**, most of which have been published in leading conferences and journals in the fields of image processing and hardware implementation, including **TMM, CVM, MMM, ISCAS, DCC, ICIP, IJCNN**, among others. 

I possess a strong ability for **self-directed learning** and have **independently acquired knowledge** in areas relevant to my research topic during my graduate studies, as well as in iOS application development during my undergraduate studies.

I am currently actively seeking post-doctoral or researcher opportunities and aspire to join a growth-oriented team where I can make meaningful contributions to advancement and development.
