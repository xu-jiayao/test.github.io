# üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Profile 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hosei University in March 2024 and my M.S. degree in September 2020. 

My **research interest** lies in _**Image Codec design**_ based on _**Compressive Sensing**_, which encompasses _**Hardware Implementation**_ and _**Deep Learning**_. 

Throughout my doctoral and master's studies, I have authored **10 papers**, most of which have been published in leading conferences and journals in the fields of image processing and hardware implementation, including **TMM, CVM, MMM, ISCAS, DCC, ICIP, IJCNN**, among others. 

I possess a strong ability for **self-directed learning** and have **independently acquired knowledge** in areas relevant to my research topic during my graduate studies, as well as in iOS application development during my undergraduate studies.

I am currently actively seeking post-doctoral or researcher opportunities and aspire to join a growth-oriented team where I can make meaningful contributions to advancement and development.

**Improve the Compression Ratio: MATLAB**

 Existing Issues:
‚Äì The compression ratio achieved by the initial CS-based codec is insufficient.
‚Äì To improve the compression ratio, intra-prediction, quantization, and entropy coding are integrated into
the original framework.
‚Äì Intra-prediction results in time consumption.
‚Äì The input data lacks sufficient sparsity for quantization, resulting in noticeable quality degradation as
the quantization parameter increases, despite improved compression rates.

‚ó¶ Our Proposal:
‚Äì The previous simplified reconstruction algorithm was divided into two distinct components. It was
observed that processing the first reconstruction part yielded sparser data.
‚Äì Moving the first reconstruction part to the encoder reduces decoding time and functions similarly to
intra-prediction in other methods, with minimal complexity increase for obtaining sparser data.
‚Äì Leveraging this sparser data improves the compression ratio and reduces quantization degradation.
‚Äì This effort yielded a reduction of 16.16% in bpp, accompanied by a 38.46% increase in quality, and an
overall speedup of 165.18 √ó in terms of time cost.

**Speedup Reconstruction: FPGA**

‚ó¶ Existing Issues:
‚Äì Time cost of reconstruction is the Primary bottleneck in CS.
‚Äì Current reconstruction efforts aim to enhance speed while ensuring the generality of the measurement matrix.
‚Äì There‚Äôs a tradeoff between generality and speed, with hardware limitations preventing alteration of the selected sampling matrix.

‚ó¶ Our Proposal:
‚Äì Identify a sampling matrix that produces a sparse sensing matrix for reconstruction, yielding high-quality results.
‚Äì Utilize the sparsity of the sensing matrix to streamline each iteration in the reconstruction process.
‚Äì Simplify the reconstruction further, replacing iterative reconstruction with a single matrix multiplication.
‚Äì Achieve the fastest reconstruction speed of 81.92Gpixels/s while demanding minimal hardware resources

**Improve the Image Quality: Python, Pytorch, OpenCV, MATLAB**

‚ó¶ Existing Issues:
‚Äì Higher sampling rates improve quality for high-frequency blocks, with minimal impact on low-frequency
ones.
‚Äì Adaptive sampling is introduced in existing works to tackle this issue.
‚Äì Computation of sampling rates per block in existing works is image-based, requiring two rounds of
sampling and reconstruction, leading to high time and hardware costs.
‚ó¶ Our Proposal:
‚Äì Investigating the correlation between the sampling procedure and edge detection calculation, the edge
detection method is implemented by multiplying a vector with sampled data.
‚Äì Achieving adaptive sampling calculation on the sampled data, saving hardware and time costs without
requiring additional reconstruction.
‚Äì Integrated without change into any compressive sensing-based codec framework, achieving plug-and-
play capability.
‚Äì Enhancing existing methods by 0.8-4.27dB under the same sampling rate
